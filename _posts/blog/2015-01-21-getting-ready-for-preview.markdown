I polished up some more things on the website, getting ready for a public Microsoft blog post about JUniversal by Monday, the 26th.

The getting started page can use some more work to completely finish.   And I'd like to add a FAQ and intro JSimple doc, but those can come later.
Still, I'm happy with the progress here.
